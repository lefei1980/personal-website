6️⃣ Deployment Strategy
CI/CD Flow

Push to main

GitHub Action builds static site

Cloudflare Pages pulls from GitHub

Auto deploy

No manual deployment.

7️⃣ Authentication Strategy

Use GitHub OAuth for Decap CMS login.

No custom password system.

Security Model:

Only authorized GitHub accounts can commit content

Public site remains fully static

8️⃣ Why No Backend Is Required

Because:

Blog content = Markdown files

Images = static assets

CMS = Git-based

Hosting = static CDN

A backend would only be needed for:

User accounts

Comment system

Database-driven content

Private content

These are explicitly out of scope.

9️⃣ Scalability Strategy

This architecture scales well because:

Static delivery via CDN

No runtime execution

No database bottlenecks

No server maintenance

Future expansion options:

Add Cloudflare Functions if needed

Add Supabase for database features

Add analytics integration

Add comment system (e.g., Giscus)
