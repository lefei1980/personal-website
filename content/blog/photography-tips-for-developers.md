# Photography Tips for Developers

As a software engineer who loves travel photography, I've discovered surprising parallels between writing code and taking great photos. Here's what I've learned.

## 1. Composition is Like Code Structure

Just as clean code follows principles like **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) and **SOLID**, good photos follow compositional rules:

### Rule of Thirds
Imagine a 3x3 grid over your frame. Place key elements at intersections:

```
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│     │     │     │
├─────┼─────┼─────┤  ← Place subject here
│     │  ✓  │     │
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│     │     │     │
└─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

### Leading Lines
Guide the viewer's eye, just like guiding code execution flow.

## 2. Lighting = Debugging

Bad lighting ruins a photo like bugs ruin code. Golden hour (sunrise/sunset) is your production environment - everything looks better.

**Key lighting scenarios:**

| Time | Quality | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| Golden Hour | Warm, soft | Portraits, landscapes |
| Blue Hour | Cool, moody | Cityscapes, architecture |
| Midday | Harsh, contrasty | Shadows, minimal scenes |

## 3. Post-Processing = Refactoring

Don't over-process! Like refactoring code, edits should enhance, not transform:

```python
# Good: Subtle adjustments
photo.adjust(
  exposure = +0.3,
  contrast = +10,
  saturation = +5
)

# Bad: Over-processed
photo.adjust(
  saturation = +100,  # Nuclear sunset
  clarity = +50,      # HDR nightmare
  vibrance = +80      # Cartoon mode
)
```

## 4. Backup Your RAW Files

Treat photos like source code:

- **RAW files = Source code** (keep forever)
- **JPEGs = Compiled output** (can regenerate)
- **Use version control** (cloud storage with versioning)

## 5. Iterate and Learn

Every photo is a commit. Review your work:

```bash
git log --photos --last-trip
# What worked?
# What didn't?
# How can I improve?
```

## Gear Recommendations

You don't need the latest camera, just like you don't need the newest MacBook to write good code.

**My travel kit:**
- Fujifilm X-T4 (lightweight, excellent JPEGs)
- 18-55mm lens (versatile range)
- Peak Design sling (quick access)

## Conclusion

Photography and programming share a core principle: **practice makes perfect**. Take more photos, review them critically, and iterate.

Now get out there and capture some memories!
